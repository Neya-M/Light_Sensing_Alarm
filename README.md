# Light_Sensing_Alarm
An alarm triggered with bright light!

I was wondering what useful things I could make with a photoresistor... This is what I came up with!

# Bill of Materials
I didn't need many parts for this, here's the bill of materials:

- 1 coin battery holder
- 6 resistors (values TBD)
- 1 photoresistor
- 3 NPN transistors
- 1 LED
- 2 10uF capacitors
- 1 buzzer motor

I might add a potentiometer later to control light sensitivity but that's it for now.
